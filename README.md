# 2017-2018 Stock Analysis Project Using VBA
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of the project was to refactor some VBA code that I created. The original macro ran well, but wasn't running as efficiently or fast as it could. It was designed to show which companies would be the best to invest in given stock data from 2017 and 2018. In order to edit the macro for larger datasets in the future, I created an index with multiple arrays so that the macro only looped through the data one time. Both macros accomplish the same task and utilize many of the same tools (i.e., indexes, for loops, if then statements, etc.), but they end up looking very different by the end.
### The Given Data
