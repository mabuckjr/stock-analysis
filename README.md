# 2017-2018 Stock Analysis Project Using VBA
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of the project was to refactor some VBA code that I created. The original macro ran well, but wasn't running as efficiently or fast as it could. It was designed to show which companies would be the best to invest in given stock data from 2017 and 2018. In order to edit the macro for larger datasets in the future, I created an index with multiple arrays so that the macro only looped through the data one time. Both macros accomplish the same task and utilize many of the same tools (i.e., indexes, for loops, if then statements, etc.), but they end up looking very different by the end.
### The Given Data
The original data is distributed into 8 columns: Ticker, Date, Opening Price, High Price, Low Price, Closing Price, Adjusted Closing Price, and Volume of Trades. There are 2 different sheets representing the values for both 2017 and 2018. The twelve companies (represented by their tickers) are AY, CSIQ, DQ, ENPH, FSLR, HASI, JKS, RUN, SEDG, SPWR, TERP, and VSLR. For every day with active trades, the appropriate data is displayed in the columns. The ultimate goal was to extract the tickers, the total daily volume, and return for each stock from either the 2017 or 2018 sheet using one subroutine.
