# 2017-2018 Stock Analysis Project Using VBA
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of the project was to refactor some VBA code that I created. The original macro ran well, but it wasn't running as efficiently or fast as it could. It was designed to show which companies would be the best to invest in given the provided stock data from 2017 and 2018. In order to edit the macro for larger datasets in the future, I created an index with multiple arrays so that the macro only looped through the data one time. Both macros accomplish the same task and utilize many of the same tools (i.e., indexes, for loops, if then statements, etc.), but they end up looking quite different by the end.
### Background
The original data is distributed into 8 columns: Ticker, Date, Opening Price, High Price, Low Price, Closing Price, Adjusted Closing Price, and Volume of Trades. There are 2 different sheets representing the values for both 2017 and 2018. The twelve companies (represented by their tickers) are AY, CSIQ, DQ, ENPH, FSLR, HASI, JKS, RUN, SEDG, SPWR, TERP, and VSLR. For every day with active trades, the appropriate data is displayed in the columns for all companies. The ultimate goal was to extract the tickers, the total daily volume of stock traded, and return on investment for each company from either the 2017 or 2018 sheet (using one macro).
## Results
### Old/New Code Comparison
#### Old Code
Below is the code that I originally created to obtain results for the 2017/2018 stock data:
```
Sub AllStocksAnalysis()
    
    'To find out how long this Subroutine will take
     Dim startTime As Single![2017 Stock Results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72943588/123744911-53408a80-d864-11eb-97c7-d9385da47a5c.PNG)

     Dim endTime As Single
     
     'To switch between different years
     yearValue = InputBox("What year would you like to run the analysis on?")

        startTime = Timer
        
    '1 Format the output sheet on the "All Stocks Analysis" worksheet.
        Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
        
            Range("A1").Value = "All Stocks (" + yearValue + ")"
        
                'Create a header row
                Cells(3, 1).Value = "Ticker"

                tickers(4) = "FSLR"
                tickers(5) = "HASI"
                tickers(6) = "JKS"
                tickers(7) = "RUN"
                tickers(8) = "SEDG"
                tickers(9) = "SPWR"
                tickers(10) = "TERP"
                tickers(11) = "VSLR"
        
        '3a Initialize variables for the starting price and ending price.
            Dim startingPrice As Single
            Dim endingPrice As Single
        
        '3b Activate the data worksheet.
            Worksheets(yearValue).Activate
        
        '3c Find the number of rows to loop over.
            RowCount = Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
            
         '4 Loop through the tickers.
        For i = 0 To 11
        
                ticker = tickers(i)
                totalVolume = 0
                
                '5 Loop through rows in the data.
                Worksheets(yearValue).Activate
                For j = 2 To RowCount
                    '5a Find the total volume for the current ticker.
                        If Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then
                        
                        totalVolume = totalVolume + Cells(j, 8).Value
                    
                        End If
                '5b Find the starting price for the current ticker.
                        If Cells(j - 1, 1).Value <> ticker And Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then
                        
                        startingPrice = Cells(j, 6).Value
                            
                        End If
                    
                '5c Find the ending price for the current ticker.
                        If Cells(j + 1, 1).Value <> ticker And Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then
                        
                        endingPrice = Cells(j, 6).Value
                        
                        End If
            
                Next j
            Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
            Cells(4 + i, 1).Value = ticker
            Cells(4 + i, 2).Value = totalVolume
            Cells(4 + i, 3).Value = (endingPrice / startingPrice) - 1
    Next i
    
    'To display the ending time
    endTime = Timer
    MsgBox "This code ran in " & (endTime - startTime) & " seconds for the year " & (yearValue)
  End Sub
  ```
 This code worked well, but looped through the data multiple times, causing processing time to be upwards of .5 seconds when I ran it:

#### Refactored Code
By Creating an Index that referenced arrays that referenced arrays for tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices, and tickerEndingPrices, I created a subroutine that was much faster than the previous (see the refactored section of code and screenshots below):
```
 '1a) Create a ticker Index
    tickerindex = 0
        
    '1b) Create three output arrays
    Dim tickerVolumes(12) As Long
    Dim tickerStartingPrices(12) As Single
    Dim tickerEndingPrices(12) As Single
            
    
    
    '2a) Create a for loop to initialize the tickerVolumes to zero.
    For i = 0 To 11
        tickerVolumes(i) = 0
    Next i
        
    '2b) Loop over all the rows in the spreadsheet.
    For i = 2 To RowCount
        
    
        '3a) Increase volume for current ticker
        tickerVolumes(tickerindex) = tickerVolumes(tickerindex) + Cells(i, 8).Value
                    
        
        '3b) Check if the current row is the first row with the selected tickerIndex.

        If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerindex) And Cells(i - 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerindex) Then
            tickerStartingPrices(tickerindex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
        End If
            
        
        '3c) check if the current row is the last row with the selected ticker
        'If the next row√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s ticker doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t match, increase the tickerIndex.
        If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerindex) And Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerindex) Then
            tickerEndingPrices(tickerindex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
        End If
            

        '3d Increase the tickerIndex.
        If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerindex) And Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerindex) Then
            tickerindex = tickerindex + 1
        End If
            
    
    Next i
    
    '4) Loop through your arrays to output the Ticker, Total Daily Volume, and Return.
    For i = 0 To 11
        
        Worksheets("All Stocks Analysis").Activate
        Cells(4 + i, 1).Value = tickers(i)
        Cells(4 + i, 2).Value = tickerVolumes(i)
        Cells(4 + i, 3).Value = tickerEndingPrices(i) / tickerStartingPrices(i) - 1
        
    Next i
   ```

   As you can see, there is a significant decrease in the output time for the macro.
   ### Stock Results
   In 2017, most of the stocks did pretty well! Only TERP had a negative return; for the most part, the other stocks had a great return that year! See below:

   However, the return for the 2018 stocks was mostly negative, except ENPH and RUN which had great returns that year. See the picture linked below:

   ## Summary
   ### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
   #### Advantages
   One of the biggest advantages to refactoring code is streamlining the work that the computer must do to run a subroutine, making the code run more smoothly. For instance, the first macro I created looped through the data multiple times, making the computer "work harder" and thus take longer. The new method made it easier for the computer to run the code since it only processed the data once. Refactoring can also make code easier to understand, which is helpful when working with a team. Practice makes progress, and I bet people who refactor often are also those that build on their skills so they can create more efficient code in the future.
#### Disadvantages
It seems like the biggest disadvantage to refactoring is how time-consuming the process can be. It's hard to figure out certain problems, so there are times where all you can do is experiment and ask for help either online or from a teammate.
### Refactoring the Stock Analysis Script
Our code greatly benefitted from refactoring it. It runs quicker and could quickly process even more data than before. It is actually easier to follow as well, since there aren't as many For-loops. I would say that my only problem with refactoring was that I got hung up on how to address 3b-3d for a few hours before I finally figured it out. While it was a great reward to see my code run so efficiently, I just wish I could have been more efficient myself üòÅ
